<h1>INTRO TO IT ASSESSMENT 1: MY PROFILE</h1>
  <h4> Name: Madisyn Freeman </h4>
  <h4> Student Number: s3793987 </h4>
  <h4> Email: s3793987@student.rmit.edu.au </h4>
  
  <h2>About me</h2>
<p> My name is Madisyn and I’m a 22-year-old student from Melbourne. I am currently in my final year of a Bachelor of Arts Degree at 
  Monash University, in which I am majoring in Psychology and minoring in Criminology and Human Rights. In addition, I have begun 
  studying Information Technology online this year with RMIT. I also work part-time at a call centre, and I compete in ballroom and 
  Latin dancing competitions regularly. </p>

  <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    
    <h4> What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h4>
    <p>I have only very recently developed an interest in IT. I think, being a woman, IT never really presented itself as an option during 
      school and so I never even considered it as a possible career path that I might enjoy. It’s only really been in the last 6 months 
      that I have considered IT as an option. This has come about due to a couple of reasons. </p>

    <p>Firstly, I’m nearing the end of my Bachelor of Arts degree and so I have been considering different options of where to head next 
      and what I really want to choose as a career. </p>

    <p>Secondly, one of my closest friends began a cyber security course last year and she has shown me some of the projects that she has 
      completed and the assignments she has done. It really amazed me how my friend had built entire websites and programs from scratch. 
      I think that is what interests me most about IT – the idea that I can build something useful and exciting all just with a computer. 
      And I think building something from scratch like that would be very rewarding and give me a great sense of achievement. </p>

    <p>I really have no prior IT experience at all, other than of course being an avid user of the IT that is all around us everyday.</p>
  
    <h4>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h4>
    <p>I chose to come to RMIT so that I could get a taste of what a career in IT might be like. I am studying both the Introduction to IT 
      and Introduction to Programming subjects this study period to explore my new-found interest in IT and see whether it is something I 
      should pursue after I complete my Bachelor of Arts this year. I also chose RMIT because the flexibility of the online course is ideal
      for fitting my IT studies in with my other studies, as well as with my work commitments and spending time with friends and family. </p>
  
    <h4> What do you expect to learn during your studies? </h4>
    <p>I am hoping that within this course I learn a lot more about the basics of IT – what it is; how it functions within society; and 
      whether it is something that I enjoy learning about and practicing. More so, I am hoping that I get an idea of the different types 
      of careers I could have in IT and whether any of them are viable options for me. I am also hoping that I develop some practical IT 
      skills, such as learning the basics of some programming languages, so that I am able to build basic websites and programs. </p>
  

  
  <h2> Ideal Job </h2>
  
  <p> Below is a screenshot of a <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38401937?type=standard&searchrequesttoken=75a4de01-3a22-4fef-828a-18bf66ad0fbb"> 
  job advertisement <a> for a user interface/user experience designer for Robert Half Technology. The job is a 3-month contract in which I would 
    play a part in re-designing a software application.</p> <br>
    
  <img src = "mlfree.github.io/Ideal-job.png" alt = "Screenshot of ideal job adertisement"> 
   
    <p>This position appeals to me in that it involves a bit of creativity. It would require me to help design and build an application, 
      and therefore I think this would give me quite a sense of achievement when the job is completed. The advertisement also lists 
      Psychology as a relevant tertiary qualification for this job, so I would be interested to see how my psychology training would be 
      used in a position like this (perhaps in the ‘User Research’ component of the position). Finally, I find the fact that the position 
      is only a 3-month contract quite appealing. I think I would enjoy the flexibility of freelance work, as well as the fact that it 
      would mean that I could try my hand at a variety of different kinds of projects, perhaps making working life less monotonous. </p>
