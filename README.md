## INTRO TO IT - ASSESSMENT 1

Personal Information
Name: Madisyn Freeman
Student Number: s3793987
Email: s3793987@student.rmit.edu.au

My name is Madisyn and I’m a 22-year-old student from Melbourne. I am currently in my final year of a Bachelor of Arts Degree at Monash University, in which I am majoring in Psychology and minoring in Criminology and Human Rights. In addition, I have begun studying Information Technology online this year with RMIT. I also work part-time at a call centre, and I compete in ballroom and Latin dancing competitions regularly. 

Interest in IT
I have only very recently developed an interest in IT. I think, being a woman, IT never really presented itself as an option during school and so I never even considered as a possible career path I might enjoy. It’s only really been in the last 6 months that I have considered IT as an option. This has come about due to a couple of reasons. Firstly, I’m nearing the end of my Bachelor of Arts degree and so I have been considering different options of where to head next and what I really want to choose as a career.  In addition, one of my closest friends began a cyber security course last year and she has shown me some of the projects that she has completed and the assignments she has done. It really amazed me how my friend had built from scratch entire websites and programs. I think that is what interests me most about IT – the idea that I can build something exciting and useful all just with a computer and I think doing so would be very rewarding and give me a great sense of achievement. I really have no prior IT experience at all, other than of course being a user of the IT that is all around us everyday. 

I chose to come to RMIT so that I could get a taste of what a career in RMIT might be like. I am studying both the Introduction to IT and Introduction to Programming subjects this study period to explore my new-found interest in IT and see whether it is something I should pursue after I complete my Bachelor of Arts this year. I also chose RMIT because the flexibility of the online course is ideal for fitting my IT studies in with my other studies, as well as with my work commitments and spending time with friends and family. 

I am hoping that within this course I learn a lot more about the basics of IT – what it is, how it functions within society and whether it is something that I enjoy learning about and practicing. More so, I am hoping that I get an idea of the different types of careers I could have in IT and whether any of them are viable options for me. I am also hoping that I develop some practical IT skills, such as learning the basics of some programming languages so that I am able to build basic websites and programs. 

Ideal Job

Above is a link to a job advertisement as a user interface/user experience designer for Robert Half Technology. The job is a 3-month contract in which I would play a part in re-designing a software application. 

This position appeals to me in that it involves a bit of creativity. It would require me to help design and build an application, and therefore I think this would give me quite a sense of achievement when the job is completed. The advertisement also lists Psychology as a relevant tertiary qualification for this job, so I would be interested to see how my psychology training would be used in a position like this, perhaps in the ‘User Research’ component of the position. Finally, I find the fact that the position is only a 3-month contract quite appealing. I think I would enjoy the flexibility of freelance work, as well as the fact that it would mean that I could try my hand at a variety of different kinds of projects, perhaps making working life less monotonous. 

To be successful in securing this position, 3-5 years experience in a similar position as well as experience using digital design tools such as Sketch, Invision, Adobe CC and Axure is required. In addition, excellent communication skill sand experience with portfolio evidence is also highly regarded. Finally, a relevant tertiary qualification in IT, web development and/or psychology is also a requirement. 

While I do not currently have a lot of the IT experience necessary for this position, I do have some key skills that I believe would be essential to be successful within this job. For example, I have excellent time-management skills and a keen eye for detail. I have a lot of patience and an excellent work ethic, and I will not stop until a project is the best it can possibly be. I also have excellent communication skills and have plenty of experience working in teams, both within a university setting and within my current and previous jobs. 

In order for me to get to a point where I could be successful in applying for this position, there are a few steps I plan to take:
•	Finish my Bachelor of Arts, with an extended major in Psychology. 
•	Be accepted into and complete a Masters of Information Technology. 
•	Work as a junior web developer, particularly in a UI/UX development position.

Project Idea

Overview
My project idea is a new spin on location sharing apps. It involves users checking in to certain types of venues or events such as bars, pubs, clubs, festivals, concerts or sporting events when the app detects that they are at the location of said venue or event. Such an app will allow users to selectively share their location with a list of friends of their choosing. The benefit of this will be that users can check and see if any of their friends are attending the same event that they are. In addition, friends who are deciding where to heard on a night out can see where their friends are and this can help them decide where to head on their night out. 


Motivation
Location sharing apps have become quite popular in the last few years. Apple’s ‘Find My Friends’ is used by ???? amount of people. Snapchat’s Snapmaps is also very popular. The problem with these apps is that they don’t allow for enough selectivity when sharing your location. Most people don’t want all of their contacts or Snapchat friends to be able to see their location all the time. These are the solutions to this problem that current location sharing apps offer:

1.	Limit the amount of people that can see your location to just your close friends.  
2.	Turn your locations on and off depending on where you are and whether you want people to know you’re there. 

These solutions are far from perfect. Solution 1 is not ideal because there are certain times where people would be more than happy to share their location with 100 of their friends so that they could meet up with anyone nearby, and then there are certain times when they only want their close friends to know where they are. Current location sharing apps do enable you to customise and change who can see your locations, but this is time-consuming and somewhat arduous, and so is not commonly done.  

Solution 2 is easier and less time-consuming, however it requires people to remember to go into their apps and turn their locations on and off. The fact that turning your locations off is so easily forgotten may discourage users from sharing their location at all. 

My app aims to provide better solutions to the problems that arise from location sharing apps. It works on the assumption that people are happy to share their locations with a large number of friends when they are out at public events or venues, but when they return home or they are just going about their daily life they want their locations turned off. 

Description
Set up
The app will work by users first creating an account and selecting from their Facebook friends whom they wish to share their locations with when the app detects that they are at a public event or venue. 

Checking into venues
When the app does detect that they have arrived at a certain event or venue, their phone will send them a notification of which will ask “Would you like to share your attendance at [insert event or venue’s name] with your friends?” to which the user can respond with “yes” or “no’”. This means that people can selectively choose when to share their locations with their friends list without even entering the app, making it very easy to use. When the app detects that the user has left the venue, it automatically turns off the sharing of the user’s locations. 

Checking friends’ locations
Friend’s locations will be displayed in two formats:
1.	On a map and 
2.	On a list. 

The map will open as the app’s home page and it will automatically show a 30km range from the user’s current location. The user can zoom in or out from there. Every venue that has been checked into by at least one of their friends will be highlighted with a pin at it’s location on the map alongside a number that indicates how many of their friends have checked into that venue. 

The list view will list all friends that have checked into a venue alphebetised by friends’ first names, with the venue they have checked into displayed next to their name. 

There will also be a search function, whereby users can search specific friends to see if and where they have checked in, or they can search specific venues to see if any friends have checked in to that venue, and if so which friends.
