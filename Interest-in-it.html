  <h2>INTEREST IN IT</h2>
    <h4> What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h4>
    <p>I have only very recently developed an interest in IT. I think, being a woman, IT never really presented itself as an option during 
      school and so I never even considered it as a possible career path that I might enjoy. It’s only really been in the last 6 months 
      that I have considered IT as an option. This has come about due to a couple of reasons. </p>

    <p>Firstly, I’m nearing the end of my Bachelor of Arts degree and so I have been considering different options of where to head next 
      and what I really want to choose as a career. </p>

    <p>Secondly, one of my closest friends began a cyber security course last year and she has shown me some of the projects that she has 
      completed and the assignments she has done. It really amazed me how my friend had built entire websites and programs from scratch. 
      I think that is what interests me most about IT – the idea that I can build something useful and exciting all just with a computer. 
      And I think building something from scratch like that would be very rewarding and give me a great sense of achievement. </p>

    <p>I really have no prior IT experience at all, other than of course being an avid user of the IT that is all around us everyday.</p>
